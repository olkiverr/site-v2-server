        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Mangamuse! By accessing or using our services, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Mangamuse's website and services. By using this website, you accept these terms in full.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use the services. Also, we recommend you read this document carefully because we might throw in a couple of secret clauses you didn’t expect.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>2. Account Creation</h2>
            <p>To access our services, you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate information, including your name, email, and a secure password. The information you provide must be truthful, accurate, and not misleading in any way.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to verify your identity before allowing full access to our services. In case we feel like you're faking your identity, we’ll pretend to be a detective.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>By using Mangamuse, you agree to abide by the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not engage in illegal activities.</li>
                <li>Do not upload malicious content.</li>
                <li>Respect the privacy of other users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, please refrain from pretending to be someone you're not. We’re serious about that – no one likes being tricked (except maybe for magicians). And remember, we may spy on your activities for the sake of improving your experience. It’s not creepy. It’s totally legal.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>4. Use of Content</h2>
            <p>All content provided on Mangamuse, including images, text, and videos, is protected by copyright law. You may not use it without prior permission from the rightful owner. Unauthorized use of content is strictly prohibited and will result in legal consequences.</p>
            <p>That being said, we still hope you’ll enjoy our content as much as we enjoy creating it. You’re free to look at it, share it (but not take credit for it), and even daydream about it.</p>
            <p>Remember, you are granted a limited license to use our content only within the confines of our services, and you may not try to reverse engineer it, replicate it, or send it to the moon (unless you're Elon Musk and we have written permission).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>5. Privacy and Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We take privacy seriously. However, by using Mangamuse, you acknowledge that we may collect personal information, including your browsing data, usage patterns, and preferences, to improve your experience and to send you updates about new features.</p>
            <p>We might collect your email address, but only because we want to spam you with beautiful newsletters about the latest content, just kidding. We promise we’ll only send you useful stuff (most of the time).</p>
            <p>We may also track your activities on the website, but don’t worry, we aren’t interested in what you had for lunch unless it’s related to our content.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we do our best to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
            <p>Should there be a breach of security, we will notify you immediately. But honestly, if someone hacks into Mangamuse, it’s probably because they’re trying to unlock the secret content we’ve hidden in the system.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>7. Limitations of Liability</h2>
            <p>We are not responsible for any damages, whether physical, emotional, or intellectual, caused by reading these Terms and Conditions. You’ve been warned!</p>
            <p>In other words, by continuing to use Mangamuse, you’re agreeing that if anything bad happens, we’re not to blame. Except if you get trapped in an infinite loop of reading these terms. Then, we apologize in advance.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>8. Termination</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Mangamuse at any time without notice, if we suspect you’ve violated any of these terms. If you do get kicked out, don’t take it personally. We just want what’s best for you.</p>
            <p>If we ever find out that you’ve been using Mangamuse solely to procrastinate instead of actually enjoying the content, we may have to reconsider your membership. No offense, though.</p>
